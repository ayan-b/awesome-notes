# Awesome Notes

ðŸ“š Awesome notes/books on GitHub and elsewhere that you can read for free.

## Compilers

- [**Crafting Interpreters**](https://craftinginterpreters.com): Crafting Interpreters contains everything you need to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. Youâ€™ll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. Itâ€™s a blast. ([GitHub](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters))

- [**The Super Tiny Compiler**](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler): This is an ultra-simplified example of all the major pieces of a modern compiler written in easy to read JavaScript.

## JavaScript

- [**You Don't Know JavaScript**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS): A series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language.

- [**Functional Light JS**](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS): A balanced, pragmatic look at FP in JavaScript.

- [**JavaScript Design Patterns for Humans**](https://github.com/sohamkamani/javascript-design-patterns-for-humans): An ultra-simplified explanation of design patterns implemented in JavaScript.

- [**Patterns.dev**](https://patterns.dev): Patterns.dev is a free book on design patterns and component patterns for building powerful web apps with vanilla JavaScript and React.

## Database

- [**Let's Build a Simple Database**](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/): Writing a sqlite clone from scratch in C. ([GitHub](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial))

## Git

- [**Write yourself a Git**](https://wyag.thb.lt/): This article is an attempt at explaining the Git version control system from the bottom up, that is, starting at the most fundamental level moving up from there. This does not sound too easy, and has been attempted multiple times with questionable success. But thereâ€™s an easy way: all it takes to understand Git internals is to reimplement Git from scratch. 

## Browser

- [**Web Browser Engineering**](https://browser.engineering): Web browsers are ubiquitous, but how do they work? This book explains, building a basic but complete web browser, from networking to JavaScript, in a thousand lines of Python.

## Linter

- [**Making Your Own JavaScript Linter**](https://medium.com/codex/making-your-own-javascript-linter-part-1-ee9f91dc49d8): We will see the fundamental concepts and the source code of a real linter written in JavaScript, including algorithms for the tricky parts.

## Coding Interview

- [**Get that job at Google**](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html): Get that job at Google by Steve Yegge.
